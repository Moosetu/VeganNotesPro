Can't find the copied recipes for the dim sum you often make?

I have a snack that I want to make temporarily, but the ratio of ingredients in the recipe I found online is different from the usual recipe? Private recipes can solve your troubles.

Add a variety of recipes that you like and often make, so you can open the recipes to cook food at any time. It has a built-in timing function, and you can upload pictures of materials or steps. After the materials and steps are prepared, you can directly time them

You don't need to leave the screen, and the timing will continue when you check the materials and steps. I hope you like it.
